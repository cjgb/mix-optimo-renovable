# Analysis of a 100% renewable electrical production mix in Spain

The information about the purpose of this repo can be found at [_Un ejemplo de regresión con pérdidas asimétricas_](https://www.datanalytics.com/2022/09/06/regresion-perdidas-asimétricas/). There, however, emphasis is made on the statistical aspects of the _regression_.

This repo has been created in case somebody wants to build on the code and ideas around the feasibility of a 100% renewable electricity generation mix in Spain.

No claim is done that the assumptions behind the code presented here close to realistic. The link above does mention a number of first order caveats that will surely affect the results. If you agree with me in not agreeing with them, do please fork this repo and implement your own (and, please, share them back!).
